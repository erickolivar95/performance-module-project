1. Install Docker desktop in the computer and WSL 2. In order for this to work well, it is recommended to have windows 10 pro (if using windows).
   - For Docker desktop on windows:
     https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/
   - For WSL 2:
     https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-manual

2. Open Docker desktop and create an account in the sign in button from the top, and keep the docker desktop opened

3. Install Postgresql in: https://www.postgresql.org/download/

4. Execute the database and commands in the "Command in Postgres pgadmin" text file in this project

5. Open the cmd of the computer (on windows), set the directory of the root of the performance-module project (where the pom.xml is)
   by typing "cd (the directory of the project)", and then execute the command "docker-compose up". To finish executing the project 
   after doing the "docker-compose up" you have to press ctrl+c. If you want to remove the containers created in the docker desktop 
   you can execute the command "docker-compose down". If you want to remove all the data stored in the virtual database in the docker, 
   you have to remove first the container created in docker desktop of the project and then remove the volumes in the docker desktop

6. Open swagger by going tp localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html# in the browser to use the endpoints. First you have to login in the page

   - User: John, Password: test123, Role: employee
   - User: Mary, Password: test123, Role: manager
